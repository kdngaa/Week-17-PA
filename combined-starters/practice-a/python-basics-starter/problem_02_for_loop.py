# FOR LOOP
#
# In this problem, write a function named "my_for_loop" that accepts an
# iterable of strings as a parameter and returns a new list with strings from
# the original list that are longer than five characters. The function must use
# a for loop in its implementation.
#
# There are two sample data calls for you to use.

# __________SAMPLE TEST DATA__________ #
# test = ["nope", "yes this one", "not", "uhuh", "here's one", "narp"]
# print(my_for_loop(test))  # > ["yes this one", "here's one"]

# test = ["plop", "", "drop", "zop", "stop"]
# print(my_for_loop(test))  # > []

# test = []
# print(my_for_loop(test))  # > []
