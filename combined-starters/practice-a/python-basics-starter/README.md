# Python Practice Assessment

Congratulations on learning the basics of Python! Now, here's a practice
assessment for you to help you study for next week's assessment.

In this assessment, you will write Python code to make a series of unit tests
pass.

## Getting started

1. Change directory into the practice assessment repository.
3. Make sure you are running a version of Python 3.9.
4. Run `python -m unittest` to make sure the tests run.

## Usage

1. **Manually test by typing `python problem_01_conditional.py`**. Before you 
   run all the unit tests, use manual testing to compare your result with the
   expected result from the problem description. You may need to uncomment the 
   manual test cases. The file name may be changed to the file that you would 
   like to test.
2. **Run the tests by typing `python -m unittest`**. This will run all unit 
   tests. If you would only like to run tests for a specific file, you may also 
   provide a path to the test file, such as 
   `python -m unittest test/test_problem_o1_conditional.py`.
3. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the Python modules so that 
   when you run `python -m unittest`, all tests pass.
